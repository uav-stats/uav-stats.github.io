Gentlemen,   I flew in a helicopter today to take pictures of the Delaware Special Olympics Polar Plunge in Rehoboth Beach along with another helicopter from the Delaware State Police.  Unseen to us, there was a heavy octo-copter DRONE also taking aerial photographs.  At our altitude.  

I have enclosed a link to SKY JAC aerial photography who was and continues to fly DRONES commercially.
