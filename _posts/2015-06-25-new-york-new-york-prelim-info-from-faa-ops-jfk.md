Summary: Safety report received via e-mail from AMX concerns a drone reported by their crew to JFK LC2 on 6/25/2015. FLM on duty remembers ATCS told him AMX saw a drone on his left. A scan of R-ACD showed a police helo to the left of AMX, and FLM believed that was what was seen by AMX. The controller did not mention that the pilot had reported the drone 100' below him and "almost had a midair." This information was gotten after numerous play backs of the voice recording. The pilot had a strong accent and made it diffucult to clearly understand what was reported. The controller is now retired and out of country.
