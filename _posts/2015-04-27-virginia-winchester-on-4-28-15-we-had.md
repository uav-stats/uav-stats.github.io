On 4/28/15 we had an unmanned aircraft system (quad copter) flying over the carnival (attendance approx. 2,000) which was apparently taking video/pictures of the event. Our officers spoke to the operator. Citizen was cooperative and stopped flying the UAS. Pictures that the UAS were posted on the Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival's (SABF) Facebook page the following morning. I spoke with SABF officials who advised that citizen had a business that does photography and marketing. Citizen tried to work out a deal with SABF to be contracted to take pictures with his UAS for the festival, but no formal agreement was made. Examples of his pictures have been posted on his website. Last fall the Winchester Public Schools used a UAS to assist with making a sort of public service announcement and I believe same cirtizen was also used for that filming. During a planning meeting held by the WPS superintendent I advised  that I believed that the person operating the UAS needed an FAA permit and the response I received was "he does this all the time." Citizen was not at this meeting to hear my concern. Please keep in mind that our only encounter with citizen so far has been cooperative. I don't want to appear that we have some issue with him. I just want to make sure people are following the rules and if we have a problem in the future we can say we've treated everyone fairly.
