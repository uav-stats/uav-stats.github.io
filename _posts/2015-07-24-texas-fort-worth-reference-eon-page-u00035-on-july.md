Reference eon page U00035:
On July 25, 2015, COOK CHILDREN HOSPITAL pilot tried to call attention to the drone operator from the top of the west side of the parking garage overlooking Thistle Hill. The drone operator ignored his requests, turned his back and looked down at his screen. At this time the drone flew from the east side of Thistle Hill to about over the Thistle Hill sidewalk and elevation varied from about 50' to 100 feet above the elevated west helipad at Cook Childrens. This prevented us from taking off and getting back in to service and taking our next call. This also could have been much worse had we arrived and hour later and arrived when the drone was flying as we may not have seen the drone upon landing at Cook Childrens Medical Center perhaps creating an in air collision with the drone. Had we not seen the drone prior to take off the same situation could have occurred creating an in air collision with the drone as our usual departure is to the west. The security officer at Cook Children could see from the elevator that we were having some sort of issue. Normally the pilot does not leave raised helipad area to yell and wave arms over the side of the parking garage. She came over to assist and she could not get the drone operators attention either. She used her radio to have another officer drive over to tell the drone operator to land. I requested that she ask the officer to get his identification. The operator refused to produce any identification citing he does this for a living and he was hired by the historical society to take pictures of Thistle Hill. He is more than 5 miles from and airport and under 400 feet. He is well within his rights and does not have to show any one anything. The security officer on the ground got pictures of the respective vehicles the operator of the drone and historical society persons left in.

For this event, law enforcement had not been notified.
