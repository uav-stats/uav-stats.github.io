Summary: Daniel Morton contacted West Tower FLM requesting to fly a UAS within Class Bravo airspace on Saturday June 20 at approximately 1500 local to film flooding in Grapevine and FM 2499. West Tower FLM contacted ROC, which disapproved the request. OM also spoke with FLM and disapproved the request. During the conversation with FLM, the UAS operator was told he could not fly the UAS within the Class Bravo. He said he would have to find a work around. On the Saturday evening news footage of a UAS over FM 2499 and the Grapevine spillway  aired during the broadcast. The area filmed is within 5 miles of DFW ATCT. A Youtube video is also online showing the flooding over FM2499 posted by KNR Media.
