Summary: RECEIVED CALL FROM COAST GUARD PILOT REPORTING HE WITNESSED DRONE OPERATIONS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO MOB AIRPORT WHILE DRIVING IN HIS VEHICLE. OPERATION WAS TAKING PLACE IN THE PALMERS TOYOTA PARKING LOT WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY MOB145001. UNDER THE RWY33 FINAL. CONTACTED AIRPORT POLICE AND THE AIRPORT MANAGER AND THEY WENT TO INVESTIGATE. Following is the email: We spoke with the GM at Palmers Toyota regarding the drone operation earlier today. He said they were filming a commercial, but would not give up the companys name who was hired to shoot the film, or the drone operator. While on-site we spoke with the person who first reported the drone operation and he provided us with a great deal of information for the FAA investigation. He said he spoke with the film crew, and told them they could not fly unmanned aircraft in such close proximity to the airport. He is in the Coast Guard at ATC Mobile and is very familiar with the layout of MOB and its arrival/departure corridors. He also mentioned that he was told the drone operators were wearing -Tower Drone- shirts. A quick Google search shows the company being based out of PNS. It does not appear that the company has a Section 333 exemption for commercial drone operations.
