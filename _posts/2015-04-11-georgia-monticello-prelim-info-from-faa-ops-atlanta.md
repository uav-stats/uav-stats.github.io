THE FIRST OFFICER SAID THAT HE DID NOT GET A GOOD LOOK AT IT BECAUSE IT WENT BY SO FAST. HE SENSED IT WAS CYLINDRICAL AND SILVER DUE TO THE SUN GLINTING OFF IT. HIS BEST GUESS WAS THAT IT WAS TWO TO THREE FEET LONG AND ONE FOOT IN DIAMETER BUT AGAIN BY THE TIME HE REALIZED THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE, IT WAS PAST THEM SO HE CANNOT PROVIDE A DEFINITE DESCRIPTION. HE THOUGHT IT WAS OPPOSITE DIRECTION BECAUSE OF THE SPEED AT WHICH IT PASSED THEM. HE BELIEVES IT PASSED RIGHT OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW AND OVER THE RIGHT WING OF THE AIRCRAFT.
