MOR Alert for P50
Number: P50-M-2015/04/16-0005
Type: Public inquiry or concern (including all pilot reported NMACs)
Date/Time: Apr 16, 2015 - 2315Z
A/C: C25B
Summary: The pilot of C25B was inbound to SDL for VA to Ry21 from the South. The Biltmore controller vectored the aircraft from over the top of PHX toward a left DW for Ry 21 at 050. After the field was reported in sight, the controller issued a visual approach clearance. When the aircraft descended through 047 on a NE bound DW heading, the pilot reported a "helicopter, you know, one of those gyro-type things" that just passed by the windscreen. I had the SDL ATCT give the pilot my phone number so I could clarify. When the pilot called, they used the term NMAC, saying the craft passed from right to left off the nose of the aircraft. The pilot stated they had no time to input any control instructions into the aircraft, but had it been 2 seconds earlier, they would have hit it. The desctription of the aircraft was a small UAV with 4 sets of rotars and a string of all red lights across the whole craft. The pilot estimated the distance from the UAV to his aircraft at between 50-75ft.

Phoenix TRACON (P50) â€“ Thursday, April 16, 2015 at 4:15 p.m. PDT:  C25B was inbound to Scottsdale (SDL) Airport from the south on a Visual Approach to Runway 21.  The pilot reported that as he entered the downwind descending through 4,700 feet a UAS passed across his windshield.  When the pilot called the facility (SDL ATCT) he said that the UAS passed off the nose of the aircraft from left to right and that he had no time to react.  The pilot stated that had it occurred two seconds earlier they would have hit the UAS.  The UAS was described as small with four rotors and a string of red lights across the whole aircraft.  The pilot described the incident as a NMAC and estimated the closest proximity was between 50 and 75 feet.
