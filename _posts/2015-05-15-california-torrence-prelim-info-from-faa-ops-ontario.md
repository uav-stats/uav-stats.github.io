Summary: The Local 2 Controller initially spotted what appeared to be a remote controlled airplane approximately 3/4 mile to 1 mile south of the airport. It appeared to resemble a high-wing Cessna and was white in color. The aircraft was doing some acrobatic maneuvers in a residential area. It appeared to be approximately 200 feet AGL at its highest point which would equate to approximately 600 feet MSL due to terrain south of the airport. The aircraft was in the air less 5 minutes. No aircraft were affected by the remote controlled aircraft so no evasive maneuvers were necessary. ROC was notified. DEN was notified. Local law enforcement, Torrance PD, was also notified.
